Blackfire lets you thoroughly test your code according to your business logic.

##  Performance Management Automation

Automate testing and improve your application performance continuously, in
development, staging, or production.
Integrate performance management seamlessly in your existing workflows and tools.

## Performance Profiling

Gather detailed performance metrics from your codeâ€™s execution, and visualize
it in Blackfire.io interactive call graphs and with a timeline view.
Find bottlenecks in the blink of an eye and check the impact of your changes
by comparing iterations in development, staging, and production servers.
